//Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).
//Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)
//Get length and width using prompt and calculate an area of rectangle (area = length x width and the perimeter of rectangle (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))
//Get radius using prompt and calculate the area of a circle (area = pi x r x r) and circumference of a circle(c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.
//Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2
//Slope is m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). Find the slope between point (2, 2) and point(6,10)
//Compare the slope of above two questions.
//Calculate the value of y (y = x2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is 0.
//Writ a script that prompt a user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?
//If the length of your name is greater than 7 say, your name is long else say your name is short.
//Compare your first name length and your family name length and you should get this output.
//Declare two variables myAge and yourAge and assign them initial values and myAge and yourAge.
//Using prompt get the year the user was born and if the user is 18 or above allow the user to drive if not tell the user to wait a certain amount of years.
//Write a script that prompt the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume some one lives just hundred years
//Create a human readable time format using the Date time object
